This project is build on react.js framework. In this project I have just shown how to use useContext and createContext hook.

#This is home page shown with header and some text below that-;

#Whenever you change the language from the header component all the text is changed in below component.This how createContext and useContext is used to control the functionality and we do not need props drilling which is difficult to apply and use.
